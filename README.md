## UX & Agile
- The complete User Experience and Agile methology are explained to this link [here](Agile.md).

## Development Tools

- **Bootstrap:** Bootstrap is a popular front-end development framework that helps developers create responsive, mobile-first websites quickly and efficiently. It provides a collection of pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components like buttons, forms, navigation bars, and grid layouts. By using Bootstrap, developers can build modern, visually consistent web pages without writing extensive custom code. It's widely appreciated for its ease of use, customization options, and ability to adapt to various screen sizes, making it a go-to tool for fast web development.
- **Modular Design:** Modular design is a system design approach that divides a system into independent, interchangeable modules. Each module performs a specific function, enabling flexibility, easy maintenance, scalability, and reusability.
- **Consistent Aesthetic:** To maintaining a unified and cohesive visual style across all elements of a design. This includes consistent use of colors, fonts, shapes, and layout, ensuring that all components appear harmonious. It enhances user experience by creating familiarity and brand identity, making designs more professional and visually appealing.

## CSS Management for Project Structure

In my project, I decided to use a single CSS file, base.css, to manage all the styling across the application.
These variables are defined within base.css, and ensuring they work correctly is crucial for applying themes consistently across the site.

By consolidating all the styles into one file, I make managing themes straightforward. If I need to switch themes or make adjustments, I only need to modify this single CSS file, which allows for a seamless transition to a new look and feel across the entire application. This approach not only simplifies maintenance but also reinforces my focus on code reuse and consistency.

Additionally, having a single CSS file helps me avoid complications related to injecting styles through Bootstrap, ensuring that the CSS variables function as intended throughout the application.

     $('#sort-selector').change(function () {
         var selector = $(this);
         var currentUrl = new URL(window.location);

         var selectedVal = selector.val();
         if (selectedVal != "reset") {
             var sort = selectedVal.split("_")[0];
             var direction = selectedVal.split("_")[1];

             currentUrl.searchParams.set("sort", sort);
             currentUrl.searchParams.set("direction", direction);

             window.location.replace(currentUrl);
         } else {
             currentUrl.searchParams.delete("sort");
             currentUrl.searchParams.delete("direction");

             window.location.replace(currentUrl);

![Color Palette](static/images/readme-images/colorpalette.webp)

As for colors I decided to use Color-Hunt. https://colorhunt.co

- **Primary Color:** `#222831` -  is a dark charcoal gray with subtle blue-green undertones, perfect for sleek and modern designs.
- <img src="static/images/readme-images/222831.webp" width="500px" height="50px">

- <img src="static/images/readme-images/000005.webp" width="500px" height="50px">


### Color Customization Process

The colour customization process in this project was designed to offer flexibility and personalisation. I have implemented a series of **CSS Variables** to define various colour palettes.

Key elements of the colour customization process include:

- **Multiple Colour Palettes**: I have created several distinct colour palettes, each with its unique style—ranging from more traditional to modern and alternative designs. The default palette, known as the **root palette**, is the primary theme that all users see upon first visiting the site.

- **CSS Variables**: The different colour palettes are implemented using CSS Variables, which allows for dynamic and flexible styling of various elements across the site. This ensures a consistent and responsive design while providing a personalised experience for each user.

### Fonts - Typography

I used a combination of classic and modern fonts to diversify myself, I've integrated [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a typeface that complements the website's aesthetic. For the main text, I've opted for [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=Lato/ "Lato") due to its classic appearance. Its make it easy to read long sentences.

![Lato Font](static/images/readme-images/lato-font.png)

To ensure accessibility and functionality across all devices and browsers, I included a fallback font stack. If Lato is unavailable, the design defaults to a generic sans-serif font, maintaining readability and visual appeal.

### Icons

As for icons and officious reason [Bootstrap Icons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/extend/icons/ "Bootstrap Icons").

## Technologies Used

### Wireframes

The wireframes for this project served as a crucial guide during the development process, essentially acting as a blueprint for the design and layout of the website. My focus was primarily on two key pages: the index (or homepage) and the product page shop. Given the repetitive nature of the products, I decided that it was a better idea to separate the homepage and the products pages. The homepage serves more as an introductory page, while the product page is a more introduction page for the webshop.

I chose to highlight only two wireframes in this README as they are the most critical to the overall user experience. Other pages did not require such detailed wireframing and followed more standard, basic templates.

### Wireframes for Homepage & Products

All wireframes for the website were designed using the **Balsamiq Desktop Application**. These wireframes served as the foundation for planning the website's layout and user experience across different devices. 

Below, you can find examples of how a typical page is structured on both desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

### Social Media Marketing

To support the website, a Facebook Business Page has been created. This serves as an additional platform for brand visibility and user engagement.

- Why businesses use Facebook pages: Social media platforms, especially Facebook, allow businesses to connect directly with their audience, foster community, and share updates about products or promotions.
- Value to the company: A Facebook page increases the company’s reach, drives traffic to the website, and creates a space for user-generated content, such as reviews and testimonials, which can further boost credibility.

## Testing

### HTML Validation

All pages have been passed through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) successfully save for a few minor issues which have been left 'as is' as attempts to correct them proved unsuccessful and lead to results which devalued the user experience. Specifically, these were:

I ensured that the HTML structure of Astro Shop adheres strictly to web standards. I utilized the W3C Validator to validate our HTML code, striving to minimize and eliminate all possible errors. There are many templates to consider but the main pages where is the focus of stite are the Homepage and the product page.
After experimenting whit different container layout and fixing all the issues validation results showed **zero errors**.

The detail of these test can evaluate on this link.

### Accessibility

Ensuring accessibility is a key priority for Astro Shop. We've taken great care to make sure our platform is inclusive and usable by as many people as possible, regardless of their abilities or the devices they are using.

Throughout the development process, we adhered to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to guarantee that our site meets accessibility standards. This includes:

- **Proper use of ARIA attributes:** We have utilized ARIA attributes effectively to enhance the accessibility of dynamic content and interactive elements, ensuring screen readers can accurately convey the information to users.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements, including forms, buttons, and navigation links, are fully accessible via keyboard navigation, making the site usable without a mouse.
- **Contrast Ratios:** We carefully selected our color scheme to ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors, making the content readable for users with visual impairments.
- **Alt Text for Images:** All images include descriptive `alt` attributes, providing context to users who rely on screen readers.

These efforts help ensure that our site is not only compliant with accessibility standards but also provides an inclusive user experience. We continue to monitor and improve the accessibility of astro-shop as we develop new features and enhancements.

### Wave Validation

I have conducted a thorough accessibility audit using the WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool). There is a smooth transition between the header of the page and the rest of the main page.

<br>

Overall, the WAVE validation confirms that our website adheres to accessibility standards, with only a few minor contrast issues that have been carefully considered in the design process. While I will continue exploring potential solutions to these issues, I have prioritized maintaining a visually cohesive and intuitive theme for the site.

### Lighthouse Validation

My Lighthouse validation results have been very promising, with high scores across most categories. One area where I noticed a slightly lower score is in SEO, and I’m actively working on improvements to achieve even better results. Lighthouse has been instrumental in helping me organize my files and optimize for performance.

<details>

  <img src="static/images/readme-images/lighthouse_mobile.webp" style="display: block; margin: auto;" alt="lighthouse mobile test">
  <br>
</details>
<br>
A specific recommendation from Lighthouse was to use the WebP format for images to improve load times. In response, I made sure that all images served through the browser are now in WebP format. However, I also understand that too much compression could negatively impact the user experience, especially on larger screens. So, I made a conscious decision to balance performance with visual quality. After gathering feedback from a diverse group of users, I confirmed that the image quality is well-received across various devices. As a result, I decided to maintain slightly larger image sizes to prioritize a smooth and visually appealing experience, even if it means sacrificing a little bit of performance.

Additionally, Lighthouse suggested reducing the CSS payload, which I’m currently considering. One option I’m exploring is breaking the main base.css file into smaller files tied to specific widgets. This would allow me to send only the necessary CSS for each page, potentially cutting down the overall size of the CSS file and improving load times.

While the desktop version scores are very high, the mobile version, although still passing, has some room for improvement. I’m committed to refining these areas to ensure the best possible experience across all devices.

### JSHint Validation

Although my project doesn't include an extensive amount of JavaScript, I can ensured that the code we do have is fully validated using [**JSHint**](https://jshint.com/). I'm pleased to report that my JavaScript code has passed the validation process with a 99% clean bill of health—no errors whatsoever.

There is only one warning that issue has probably to do JSHint interpreter itself.

### Device Testing

The website has undergone thorough testing across a variety of devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and smartphones. We focused on ensuring that the responsiveness of the site is consistent and effective across all screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience regardless of the device used.

To achieve this, we employed media queries to adapt the layout for different screen sizes. This approach ensures that when the device's dimensions fall within specific ranges, certain elements will reposition themselves, maintaining readability and proper alignment. 

For instance, on smaller screens, such as smartphones, we adjusted the distribution of content to ensure that all elements are easily accessible and clearly visible, avoiding any overlap or readability issues. The result is a fluid and intuitive experience across devices, meeting our goal of a responsive design that performs well on all tested platforms.
