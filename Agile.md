## Benefits of agile development

As mentioned in the introduction there was a learning curve associated with using agile development for the second time, however there was a received number of benefits associated as well. These benefits include:

 1. Having a plan in place. It was easier to know which task I was working on and found myself getting less distracted as I was carrying out the work associated with the project.
 2. Having a dedicated timeframe for issues to be done. This helped me stay on track in terms of timeframe for the project.
 3. Initial overall planning of the project. As a lot of thought went into the user stories I was able to have a better picture of the overall project before starting the work. This sped up production and definitely felt more organised.
 4. Easily see the benefits of collaboration. As I was working on this project on my own it was easy to see how the use of agile would benefit collaboration if multiple people where working on a project together. Especially with the Kanban board, being able to see what is being worked on and the status of the work and also being able to assign this work to individual developers.

## MoSCoW

Having created the user stories, I used **MoSCoW prioritisation** to ensure that the most important requirements were addressed first. MoSCoW is a useful technique for managing project scope and ensuring that critical tasks are prioritised, while also providing flexibility in the development process. Here's how I applied the MoSCoW method:

- **Must-Have**: Critical requirements that are essential for project success.
- **Should-Have**: Important requirements that significantly add value.
- **Could-Have**: Desirable features that provide additional benefits.
- **Won't-Have**: Features explicitly excluded from the project scope.

This method is beneficial as it allows for clear communication about what will be delivered in each iteration. It ensures that essential features are prioritised, while also managing expectations by clearly defining what will not be included. By using MoSCoW prioritisation, I was able to focus on delivering the highest value to users and stakeholders first, while still maintaining the flexibility to address lower-priority features later in the project.

## Milestones 

The project was divided into three milestones, each containing the corresponding epics and user stories: [Milestone in Projects](https://github.com/Harmonica-Men/AstroShop/milestones)
<br>

1. [Setting Up The Project @ Bear minimums](https://github.com/Harmonica-Men/AstroShop/issues/18)
- Task: The goal is to set up the project at its bare minimum.
  - EPIC 0 (Repository and Deploy Early)

2. [Basic Astro Shop Functionality](https://github.com/Harmonica-Men/AstroShop/milestone/3)
- Task: Implement basic Astro Shop functionality including models, views, and templates.
  - EPIC 1 (Viewing and Navigation)
  - EPIC 2 (Registration and User Accounts) 
  - EPIC 3 (Sorting and Searching)  
  - EPIC 4 (Pruchasing and checkout)

3. [Testing and Validation](https://github.com/Harmonica-Men/AstroShop/milestone/2)
- Task: test & validate
  - EPIC 5 (Testing and Validations) 

## User Stories and Epics

Astro Shop is designed for individuals passionate about astronomy and related subjects/objects.  

During the project planning phase, I carefully analyzed and defined the functional requirements for the platform. I considered the website's primary goals, the needs of its target audience, and the features that would deliver the most value to users. From this foundation, I crafted user stories to outline the required functionalities.  

These user stories were documented as issues on GitHub. Any requirement that was too extensive to fit into a single user story was categorized as an Epic, with related user stories grouped under it. This method ensured that large tasks could be broken down into smaller, more manageable components.  

Each user story included:  
- **Title** - A concise description summarizing the user story.  
- **Description** - Structured as: *As a **[role]**, I can **[capability]** so that **[received benefit]***.  
- **Acceptance Criteria** - Specific conditions that must be met for the feature to be accepted by the user.  
- **Unit Tasks** - A detailed breakdown of tasks required to complete the user story.  
- **MoSCoW Label** - Prioritization of tasks using the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Wonâ€™t have).  

Additionally, the following fields were tracked:  
- **Assignee** - The team member responsible for completing the user story.  
- **Milestone** - The associated Epic or project milestone.  

An Agile methodology was used to organize and execute the project. This was implemented via the GitHub Project Board, which helped manage milestones, epics, user stories, and tasks effectively. Each user story was labeled with a MoSCoW prioritization to ensure clarity and focus throughout the development process.

### Story Points

In this project, story points were used to estimate the relative complexity of each user story, enabling efficient time management and iteration planning. Each story was assigned a point value of 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, or 21 based on the Fibonacci sequence, which provides a non-linear scale to account for increasing uncertainty with more complex tasks. By analysing the tasks and acceptance criteria for each story, I determined its difficulty relative to others, ensuring a realistic assessment of workload. This method facilitated the prediction of solo velocity for each iteration, aiding in the planning of future development cycles and prioritisation of features.

### Iterations and Milestones

To organise and manage progress, I divided the project into approx. 6-7 weekly iterations, each represented by a Epic in GitHub. 

- Story Point Allocation: User stories were prioritised and assigned story points to estimate effort. The total story points were divided evenly across the 7 iterations.
- Adding to Iterations: At the start of each iteration, user stories were added until their total story points matched the planned weekly workload.
- Adjustments: Incomplete tasks at the end of an iteration were moved back to the backlog (or no-status) for refinement and included in the next iteration.

This approach ensured steady progress throughout the project while allowing flexibility to adjust as needed.

### Kanban Board

To manage and track the progress of user stories during the project, I created a Kanban Board board. The board was divided into four columns: **Epics**, **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**.

- Epics: This column contained overarching goals that grouped related user stories together. (Backlog)
- To Do: At the start of each iteration, user stories to be completed were moved here.
- In Progress: As work began on a user story, it was moved to this column.
- Done: Completed user stories were moved to this column to indicate they were finished.

This setup provided a clear and simple way to track the status of tasks throughout the project, ensuring that progress was organised and transparent.

**Github Kanboard During Development**

You can view the [Astro Shop Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/Harmonica-Men/projects/12) for a detailed overview of the project's progress and task management.

### User stories 

A user story is an explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer. User stories were created with the help of GitHub issues. Each user story contains:
* Title - Short description of the user story. 
* Description - As a **role** i can **capability** so that **received benefit**.
* Acceptance criteria - A set of conditions that a feature must meet to be accepted by the user. 
* Unit tasks - A break down of each task needed to complete user story. 
* A MoSCoW label - To prioritise tasks. 
* Assignee -  Who the user store is assigned too. 
* Milestone - Which epic this user store is associated with.

Below is an example of how the user stories where structured for this project.
